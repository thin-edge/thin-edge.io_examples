 * A structural directive that conditionally includes a template only if the user has
 * all or any of the roles passed as an input. By default the directive checks all roles:

 * ```
 * <button *c8yIfAllowed="['ROLE_RECORD_DELETE', 'ROLE_ENTRY_DELETE']" (click)="delete()" title="Delete">
 *   Delete
 * </button>
 * ```
 *
 * To check if the user has any of the required roles to view the element you need to use the `allowAny` input:
 *
 * ```
 * <button *c8yIfAllowed="['ROLE_RECORD_DELETE', 'ROLE_ENTRY_DELETE']; allowAny: true" (click)="delete()" title="Delete">
 *   Delete
 * </button>
 * ```
 *
 * or use the shorter version
 *
 * ```
 * <button *c8yIfAllowed="['ROLE_RECORD_DELETE', 'ROLE_ENTRY_DELETE']; allowAny" (click)="delete()" title="Delete">
 *   Delete
 * </button>
 * ```
